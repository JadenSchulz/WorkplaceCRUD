This application is meant to demonstrate what I've learned in my time at Conestoga College Software Engineering Technology.

This is a WPF .net desktop application designed around MVVM architectured to perform CRUD operations to a modified version of the MySql Employee's example database. CCurrently, it is a work in progress.
